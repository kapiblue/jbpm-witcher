King's Gambit
=======================

This repository stores the implementation of the Kingâ€™s Gambit quest from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as a business process in jBPM. In this quest, Geralt aims to reach the Place of Power. He faces numerous dangers, including fistfights and a massacre by three berserkes. To adopt the quest to the business process, some facts from the original description have been altered.
